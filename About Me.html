<p><font size = "5">I'm from the beautiful city of North Hollywood where I spent most of childhood exploring the city with my family. I went to North Hollywood Senior High School and flourished there because of my wonderful teachers. My calculus teacher, Grace Conde, was the first teacher who made me believe I could succeed in college. I thank her for my achievements today. Futhermore, I thank Upward Bound for helping me in my journey to USC.

I am a studying Industrial Systems Engineering at the University of Southern California. I am a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, a brother and current secretary of Sigma Delta Alpha Fraternity Incorporated, and a volunteer for Teach For Los Angeles. I work at the Distance Education Network to ensure anyone who wants quality lectures can recieve them even if they're not present.
