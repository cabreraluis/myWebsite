<p>
I'm from the beautiful city of North Hollywood; the city where I grew up. I went to North Hollywood Senior High School and flourished there because of my wonderful teachers. My calculus teacher, Grace Conde, was the first teacher who propelled me to success in college. I thank her for my achievements today. I also thank Upward Bound for helping me in my journey to USC.
